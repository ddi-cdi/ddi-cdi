DDI-CDI evolved from the earlier DDI Moving Forward (DDI 4) effort. That
effort involved multiple teams and in-person meetings (Sprints), both in
Europe and North America. The first Moving Forward sprint took place at
Schloss Dagstuhl, the Leibniz Center for Informatics, in October 2012.
Five goals were listed: Improve DDI usability, Expand DDI coverage,
Express the model in different technical format, Repackage the
specification, and Enhance the documentation.

In time, the effort became extremely broad. The development of DDI
Moving Forward (DDI 4) involved 23 multi-day working events since 2012
(total of 109 days), 14 working groups, 115 participants coming from 65
organizations. The result of this work was a distilled mass of knowledge
coming from the community which serves not only as the foundation of
DDI-CDI but will also be the basis of future work.

An early decision was to use a subset of UML to represent the model.
That has carried over to DDI-CDI, with a UML model expressed in
canonical XMI as the official representation of the model and with other
syntax representations (XML, RDF) generated from the XMI. This has
resulted in the development of UML Class Model Interoperable Subset
(UCMIS) as a supporting tool for data modelling, both for DDI-CDI and
potentially other specifications.

As the project proceeded, the goals evolved. What had always been
focused on the social science domain become something broader. Even
within the social sciences the requirement for describing a broader
range of data had emerged. The CDI Working Group decided to produce a
specification which could be applied not only to social science data,
but to data coming from any domain. An effort was made to expand beyond
the social science perspective and describe data in a fashion applicable
across different domains.

In parallel with the evolution of the Moving Forward model, a
collaboration between DDI and CODATA clarified the need for a standard
supporting interoperability of metadata standards in cross-domain
research. The Moving Forward effort evolved into DDI-Cross Domain
Integration to meet this need.

DDI-CDI attempts to describe data in a generic way, with a powerful and
flexible referencing mechanism to link to metadata in more domain
specific metadata standards, including DDI Codebook and Lifecycle. It
allows for describing data at the Datum level, and along with that,
allows for tracking individual data observations across multiple
representations in varying structures.

A spreadsheet containing a listing of all participants by event can be
found at https://bitbucket.org/ddi-alliance/ddi-cdi/src/master/DDI-MovingForward_DDI-CDI_Contributors.md.
