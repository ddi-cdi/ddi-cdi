  Default value corrected, repetitive doc improved
Default values of properties reviewed and sometimes corrected. Often string values were in quotes which shouldn’t be the case.

For both, FormatDescription-ValueMapping-defaultDigitGroupSeparator and FormatDescription-ValueMapping-defaultValue, no default is now specified which could be either interpreted as null value or empty string.
Wrong quotes (“”) in doc changed to ".
Not allowed characters removed.
