| **Fully qualified package name**: DDICDIModels::Context

This package contains classes and their definitions taken from external standard models which are used to provide information about the alignment between them and the DDI-CDI model. These are in no sense the "official" definitions of these classes, but simply a way of providing a formal means of indicating their relationship to DDI-CDI constructs. This is typically done using <<trace>> relationships in the DDI-CDI model.
