Definition
==========
Definition from XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition:
"The value space of date consists of top-open intervals of exactly one day in length on the timelines of dateTime, beginning on the beginning moment of each day (in each timezone), i.e. '00:00:00', up to but not including '24:00:00' (which is identical with '00:00:00' of the next day). For nontimezoned values, the top-open intervals disjointly cover the nontimezoned timeline, one per day. For timezoned values, the intervals begin at every minute and therefore overlap." For details see https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#date.
