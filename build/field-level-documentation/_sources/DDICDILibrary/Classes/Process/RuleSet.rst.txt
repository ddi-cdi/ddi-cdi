RuleSet
*******

**Fully qualified class name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::Process:::index:`RuleSet`


Definition 
============ 
A rule set is a collection of rules. A rule set is a component of rule based scheduling.  

Examples 
========== 
If [A overlaps B] Then [X] If [B occurs before C] Then [Y] If [C equals D] Then [Z]  It might take a curator to understand what these rules mean in the context of a research data store.

Explanatory notes 
=================== 
:ref:`DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::Process::Rule` based scheduling might have multiple rule sets each of which are domain-specific. The processing agent often helps with the selection of rule sets.
