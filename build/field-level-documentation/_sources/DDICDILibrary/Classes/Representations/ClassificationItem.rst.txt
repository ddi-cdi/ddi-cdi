ClassificationItem
******************

**Fully qualified class name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::Representations:::index:`ClassificationItem`


Definition 
============ 
A space for a category within a statistical classification.   

Examples 
========== 
In the 2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) one classification item has the category "construction", and has the :ref:`DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::Representations::Code` 23, which designates construction in NAICS.

Explanatory notes 
=================== 
A classification item defines the content and the borders of the category. A unit can be classified to one and only one item at each level of a statistical classification. As such a classification item is a placeholder for a position in a statistical classification. It contains a designation, for which code is a common kind; a category; and possibly other things.   This differentiates it from code which is a only kind of designation, in particular if it is an alphanumeric string assigned to stand in place of a category. Statistical classifications often have multiple levels. A level is defined as a set of classification items each the same number of relationships from the top or root classification item.

           - A classification item may be associated with explanatory notes, which further describe and clarify the contents of the category. Explanatory notes consist of: General note: Contains either additional information about the category, or a general description of the category, which is not structured according to the "includes", "includes also", "excludes" pattern. Includes: Specifies the contents of the category. Includes also: A list of borderline cases, which belong to the described category. Excludes: A list of borderline cases, which do not belong to the described category. Excluded cases may contain a reference to the classification items to which the excluded cases belong.

This allows for the possibility of following successors of the item in the future.

           - Human understandable name (liguistic signifier, word, phrase, or mnemonic). May follow ISO/IEC 11179-5 naming principles, and have context provided to specify usage. A Classification Item has an official name as provided by the owner or maintenance unit. The name describes the content of the category. The name is unique within the Statistical Classification to which the item belongs, except for categories that are identical at more than one level in a hierarchical classification. Use the context attribute to differentiate official names or alternate names for the Classification Item.
