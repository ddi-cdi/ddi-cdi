Definition 
==========
Physical characteristics for the value of an instance variable stored in a data point as part of a physical segment layout.

Examples 
========
A variable "age" might be represented in a file as a string with a maximum length of 5 characters and a number pattern of ##0.0  

Explanatory notes 
=================
An instance variable has details of value domain and data type, but will not have the final details of how a value is physically represented in a data file. A variable for height, for example, may be represented as a real number, but may be represented as a string in multiple ways. The decimal separator might be, for example a period or a comma. The string representing the value of a payment might be preceded by a currency symbol. The same numeric value might be written as "1,234,567" or "1.234567". A missing value might be written as ".", "NA", ".R" or as "R". The value mapping describes how the value of an instance variable is physically expressed. The properties of the value mapping as intended to be compatible with the W3C Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data (https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/) as well as common programming languages and statistical packages. The 'format' property, for example, can draw from an external controlled vocabulary such as the set of formats for Stata, SPSS, or SAS.

The value of this property becomes the format annotation for the described datatype." See https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/ Tabular 6.4.2 "Formats for numeric datatypes" this may include decimalChar, groupChar, pattern "By default, numeric values must be in the formats defined in [xmlschema11-2]. It is not uncommon for numbers within tabular data to be formatted for human consumption, which may involve using commas for decimal points, grouping digits in the number using commas, or adding percent signs to the number." See https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/ Tabular 6.4. Formats for Booleans " Boolean values may be represented in many ways aside from the standard 1 and 0 or true and false." See https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/ 6.4.4. Formats for dates and times "By default, dates and times are assumed to be in the format defined in [xmlschema11-2]. However dates and times are commonly represented in tabular data in other formats." See https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/ 6.4.5 Formats for durations "Durations MUST be formatted and interpreted as defined in [xmlschema11-2], using the [ISO8601] format -?PnYnMnDTnHnMnS. For example, the duration P1Y1D is used for a year and a day; the duration PT2H30M for 2 hours and 30 minutes." See https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/ 6.4.6 Formats for other types "If the datatype base is not numeric, boolean, a date/time type, or a duration type, the datatype format annotation provides a regular expression for the string values, with syntax and processing defined by [ECMASCRIPT]. If the supplied value is not a valid regular expression, implementations MUST issue a warning and proceed as if no format had been provided." From DDI3.2 ManagedNumericRepresentation@format "A format for number expressed as a string." From DDI3.2 ManagedDateTimeRepresentation_DateFieldFormat "Describes the format of the date field, in formats such as YYYY/MM or MM-DD-YY, etc. If this element is omitted, then the format is assumed to be the XML Schema format corresponding to the type attribute value."

Implementations MUST recognise number format patterns containing the symbols 0, #, the specified decimalChar (or "." if unspecified), the specified groupChar (or "," if unspecified), E, +, % and ‰. Implementations MAY additionally recognise number format patterns containing other special pattern characters defined in [UAX35]. If the supplied value is not a string, or if it contains an invalid number format pattern or uses special pattern characters that the implementation does not recognise, implementations MUST issue a warning and proceed as if the property had not been specified. If the datatype format annotation is a single string, this is interpreted in the same way as if it were an object with a pattern property whose value is that string. If the groupChar is specified, but no pattern is supplied, when parsing the string value of a cell against this format specification, implementations MUST recognise and parse numbers that consist of: an optional + or - sign, …  Implementations MAY also recognise numeric values that are in any of the standard-decimal, standard-percent or standard-scientific formats listed in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository. …"

           - The base datatype of the physical representation. An integer InstanceVariable might, for example, be stored as a floating point number. From the W3C Recommendation "Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data" (https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/) Inherited 5.7: "datatype: An atomic property that contains either a single string that is the main datatype of the values of the cell or a datatype description object. If the value of this property is a string, it MUST be the name of one of the built-in datatypes defined in section 5.11.1 Built-in Datatypes and this value is normalized to an object whose base property is the original string value. If it is an object then it describes a more specialized datatype. If a cell contains a sequence (i.e. the separator property is specified and not null) then this property specifies the datatype of each value within that sequence. See 5.11 Datatypes and Parsing Cells in [tabular-data-model] for more details.  The normalized value of this property becomes the datatype annotation for the described column."
