| **Fully qualified package name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::DataDescription::Dimensional

This package contains the classes which are used to define multi-dimensional data structures (i.e., data cubes). It is important to note that the logical treatment of data as a multi-dimensional structure does not necessarily dictate a particular physical format for the data.
