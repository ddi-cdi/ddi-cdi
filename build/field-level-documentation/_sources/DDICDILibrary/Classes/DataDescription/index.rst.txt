DataDescription
***************

| **Fully qualified package name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::DataDescription

This package contains a number of sub-packages, looking at the variety of logical data types defined by DDI-CDI, their constituent components, and shared classes. These definitions cover both the structures of the different types of data, and also their specific instances (i.e., data sets) at a logical level. Each data type is described in a consistent fashion by assembling components, which describe the roles played by some pieces of information ("represented variables") in the data set. Some shared non-component classes are provided directly in this package.
