| **Fully qualified package name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::DataDescription::Long

This package contains classes used to define data in which observations are arranged in a stream or flow, as from sensors or entry into administrative registers, and may be understood as events over time, even if irregular. Long structures may also be generated by procedures like the R melt() function that transform a wide structure into a long structure. Some analysis procedures are designed to operate on long structures. Typically, the specific measures may vary across entries as they appear in the flow (measurements are entered in sequence, corresponding to different variables, often unpredictably), and the subject of the measure (the unit) may be repeated at several points in the stream.
