| **Fully qualified package name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::DataDescription::Components

This package contains classes which define the roles played across the different data types by represented variables (pieces of information modeled according to that construct from the conceptual package). Each type of data is defined using a consistent approach, with a selection of the components as appropriate. These typically include the way in which descriptors, measures, and identifiers are logically assembled within the data.
