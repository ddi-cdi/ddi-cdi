| **Fully qualified package name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::DataDescription::Wide

This package contains classes for defining "rectangular" data files where each unit has a series of measurements recorded for it about a regular set of variables. (Although we often think of such data as existing in rows, logically it is independent of the specific formatting, and can be seen as a repeated cluster of measures across a set of units.)
