| **Fully qualified package name**: DDICDIModels::DDICDILibrary::Classes::Conceptual

This package contains the classes in the DDI-CDI Library which define foundational metadata constructs at the conceptual level. This includes not only the primary definitional class in the model - Concept - but also many of its significant applications: variables, units (of interest, not of measurement), universes, and categories, along with supporting constructs.
Many of these classes are reused in other packages for specific purposes.
