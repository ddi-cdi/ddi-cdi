UCMIS
=====

DDI-CDI uses the UML Class Model Interoperable Subset (UCMIS). UCMIS is a subset of UML class diagram elements.
It is intended for data modeling. It focuses on core concepts familiar from object-oriented programming.
The subset focuses on elements that describe classes, their relationships to each other, and their attributes.

UCMIS supports model interoperability, specifically in the form of Canonical XMI (a special
restricted format of XMI that minimizes variability and provides predictable identification and ordering).

Further details can be found at the corresponding Git repository https://bitbucket.org/ddi-alliance/ucmis/.
