So are the Split and SplitJoin ControlConstructs\n\nExplanatory notes\n===================\nAllen's interval algebra is a calculus for temporal reasoning that was introduced in 1983. Reasoning with qualitative time in Allen's full interval algebra is nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) complete. Research since 1995 identified maximal tractable subclasses of this algebra via exhaustive computer search and also other ad-hoc methods. In 2003, the full classification of complexity for satisfiability problems over constraints in Allen's interval algebra was established algebraically."@en;

XORJoin is sometimes referred to as simple merge.\n- ANDJoin: Given three activities A, B and C, if ANDJoin(A, B) -> C, then C is executed after both A and B finish executing. ANDJoin is sometimes referred to as synchronization.\n- XORSplit: Given three activities A, B and C, if XORSplit(A) -> (B, C), then either B or C is executed, not both, after A finishes executing. XORSplit is sometimes referred to as exclusive choice.\n- ANDSplit: Given three activities A, B and C, if ANDSplit(A) -> (B, C), then both B and C are executed after A finishes executing."@en;
